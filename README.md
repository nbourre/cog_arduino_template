# cog_arduino_template
cog arduino template to create C and H file for managers

## Requirements
You need [cog](https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/) for Python installed to run this file.


# Usage
Simply call the bat file cog_arduino_template with the name of the manager you want.

E.g.:
```cog_arduino_template Sensor```
This will create two files SensorMgr.h and SensorMgr.c both of which will contains default code which I often use when doing Arduino code.
